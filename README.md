# Final Project: Custom Calculator

## Description

This is an open-ended assignment for you to practice the skills you've learned so far in order to make a custom calculator application.
This assignment will reinforce core concepts used in programming with JavaScript. You'll get a chance to practice using Flex Box, CSS styling, querySelector, and event listeners in JavaScript.

## Project requirements

Your goal is to make a calculator application to calculate a result using a custom formula. [Here](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/triangle-theorems.php) is an example of a calculator that evaluates the side lengths & angles of a triangle using mathematical theorems. Your calculator must have a theme & meaningful purpose.

Your site must have the following features:

[x] Include base HTML code (doctype, html, head, body tags)
[x] Use Flex Box for positioning the calculator elements
[] CSS styles - Use at least 6 styles to make your calculator look presentable. for example:

[] Uses form with at least 3 inputs
  [] One of those inputs must be a [select dropdown](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)
