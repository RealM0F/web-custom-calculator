# Web 1.0 Final Project: Custom Calculator

## Description

This calculator implements a function I've written for another project - calculating your Level given your total earned XP.

## Assignment Description
This is an open-ended assignment for you to practice the skills you've learned so far in order to make a custom calculator application.
This assignment will reinforce core concepts used in programming with JavaScript. You'll get a chance to practice using Flex Box, CSS styling, querySelector, and event listeners in JavaScript.

## Project requirements

Your goal is to make a calculator application to calculate a result using a custom formula. [Here](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-plane/triangle-theorems.php) is an example of a calculator that evaluates the side lengths & angles of a triangle using mathematical theorems. Your calculator must have a theme & meaningful purpose.

Your site must have the following features:

- [x] Include base HTML code (doctype, html, head, body tags)
- [x] Use Flex Box for positioning the calculator elements
- [x] CSS styles - Use at least 6 styles to make your calculator look presentable. for example: 
  - [x] font-size, font-family, margin, padding, border, color, background-color etc.
- [x] Uses form with at least 3 inputs
  - [x] One of those inputs must be a [select dropdown](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)
- [x] Uses all of the inputs to calculate the result
- [x] Result is calculated whenever an input field is modified

### Stretch Challenges

After completing the assignment to the description above try these stretch challenges: 

- [x] Publish your work to [~~GitHub Pages~~ Vercel](https://dejay-va6o3km3.vercel.app)
- [x] Create a README for your repo (Welcome!)
- [x] Set some CSS styles via JS based on the calculation
- [ ] Document your code with comments (Good luck.)
